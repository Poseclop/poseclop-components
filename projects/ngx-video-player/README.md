  - [ ] Add more attributes
  - [ ] Add more methods

## Contributing
So yeah all help is welcome. I'm kind of new to the dev community but I'll do my best to ensure new contrivutions are dully treated and hilighted.
Best way to test your contrivutions is to run `ng serve` to launch the default project (demo application) and 'ng build <library-name> --watch' to build the library on the fly.

## Build
Run `ng build ngx-video-player` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
## Running unit tests

Run `ng test ngx-video-player` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
